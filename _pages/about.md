I am a Project Associate Professor in the Department of Robotics at [Tohoku University, Japan](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Human Mechanical Systems and Design Engineering from [Hokkaido University](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/), Japan in 2015 majoring in `autonomous mobile robot navigation` and was a MEXT scholarship recepient from the government of Japan for my graduate studies from 2010-2015 (Masters and Doctoral). 

I was previously affiliated with the School of Engineering at Hokkaido University in Japan where I was an Assistant Professor from 2015 to 2021 (same lab as my graduating lab).  

My research areas are in `mobile robot navigation`, `path planning`, `multi-robot systems`, and `probabilistic inferencing and scene understanding for mobile robots`. I am particularly interested in integrating intelligent service robots in healthcare scenarios by utilizing semantic inferencing at object level. I am currently working for the [Moonshot R&D program (Goal 3)](https://www.jst.go.jp/moonshot/en/program/goal3/) with [Prof. Hirata](https://srd.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/moonshot/en/research/) and researching on the development of new assistive robot systems to support the aging population. 

I have also worked on several areas in robotics including:  Autonomous Driving in Snow Environments; Agriculture robots:  Particularly for vineyard monitoring, weed inseption, spectral imaging using UAVs; Aerial Robotics: For insepction of pier structures, spectral imaging of banana plantations, and inspection for coastal tetrapod rocks.
